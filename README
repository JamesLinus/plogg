NOTE: This branch is currently a work in progress. I haven't completed
it or written a blog post about it yet.

This is an example of using the libogg api to read and
decode Ogg files.

It is hosted on github at:

  http://github.com/doublec/plogg/tree

For more information see this weblog posts:

  http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2009/06/reading-ogg-files-using-libogg.html
  http://www.bluishcoder.co.nz/2009/06/decoding-theora-files-using-libtheora.html

The following branches are (or will be) available in the 
repository:

  master       - Combined parts to make a usable player
  part1_ogg    - Reads Ogg files but doesn't decode
  part2_theora - Extends part 1 to decode and display theora
  part3_vorbis - Extends part 1 to decode and play vorbis
  part4_avsync - Combines part 2 and 3 to play videos 
                 with synchronised audio and video.  

You will need the following third party libraries to build:

  - boost
  - SDL

The following are also required but included as submodules:

  - libogg
  - libtheora
  - libvorbis
  - libsydneyaudio

For a complete rebuild, including retrieval of this repository
and submodules:

  $ git clone git://github.com/doublec/plogg.git
  $ cd plogg
  $ git submodule init
  $ git submodule update
  $ make
